<h2 align="center">Fix for the Forza Horizon 4 Crashes</h2>

<p align="center">
Hello! Forza Horizon 4 is known for its crashes, and often it happens because of the explorer. It happened to me too, so I decided to look for a fix. 
Found some that stop and launch explorer with the num button and found it uncomfortable. I made a simple batch file that helped me a lot and I'm still using it. 
</p>

<h3>Download</h3>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/PAXANDDOS/ForzaHorizon4Fix/releases/download/1.0/FH4Fix.bat">FH4Fix.bat</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/PAXANDDOS/ForzaHorizon4Fix/releases/download/1.0/FH4Fix.Services.bat">FH4FixServices.bat</a></li>
</ul>

<h3>So how does it work?</h3>
<p>
<i>(If you run FH4Fix.bat)</i><br>
First, it starts Forza with high priority.<br>
Then you'll have to wait 50 seconds for the game to finally start. On my PC it starts after around 50 seconds so that's it.<br>
Then the explorer process will be killed, it launches again as soon as you close the game.<br><br>
If this didn't help or you've experienced some errors in-game, try launching FH4Fix Services(run as administrator). It does exactly the same thing, just checks for important Xbox services and starts them before the game.

<i>That's all. It's my first post to GitHub tho, dunno how it works yet.</i>

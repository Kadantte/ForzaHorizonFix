<h2 align="center">Fix for the Forza Horizon crashes</h2>

Hey there! :wave: Forza Horizon series turned out not to be a perfect and you may experience some unexpected game crashes. In most cases, this happens due to a running explorer.exe process. (Game from Microsoft crashing because of software from Microsoft, funny, right?)  
This fix should help you to overcome this issue! [See below.](#grey_question-how-does-it-work)

## :inbox_tray: Downloads

**_Forza Horizon 5_**

-   **Preferred version** — [Download](https://github.com/PAXANDDOS/ForzaHorizon4Fix/releases/download/v2.5/ForzaHorizon5.bat)
-   Light version — [Download](https://github.com/PAXANDDOS/ForzaHorizon4Fix/releases/download/v2.5/ForzaHorizon5_light.bat)

**_Forza Horizon 4_**

-   **Preferred version** — [Download](https://github.com/PAXANDDOS/ForzaHorizon4Fix/releases/download/v2.0/ForzaHorizon4.bat)
-   Light version — [Download](https://github.com/PAXANDDOS/ForzaHorizon4Fix/releases/download/v2.0/ForzaHorizon4_light.bat)

## :grey_question: How does it work?

Download the **preferred** version for your game above and run the batch file. This version is compatible with Windows 10 Home and Pro editions and should run correctly. Also, it is compatible with Windows 11 Home and Pro editions, but so far Windows 11 has no such problems with the Forza Horizon series. If you experienced some difficulties, you may download the _light_ version for your game, it will run without requesting admin rights and without a services check.  
After the batch file starts, it will request admin rights for further operations. It will check for required Xbox services and start them if they're disabled. Then your game will start and after some time explorer.exe process will be killed, it starts again as soon as you exit the game.

**Warning!**  
This fix is only for the Microsoft Store version of the Forza Horizon series.
Once exlorer.exe is killed, you are not able to switch between different windows (Alt+Tab) and even adjust the volume. If you want to adjust the volume or something else, enter the Ctrl+Alt+Del screen, everything works fine there.
